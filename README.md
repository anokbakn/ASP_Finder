# ASP_Finder
Foreign Language speakers Finder (will work in the entire United States and possibly Canada.

Ever wondered how to find foreign language speakers in a given area without access to census data? What if in addition to
finding them you need to go visit each single one of them, what would make it easy for you to by giving you an efficient route 
(a route with a reduced amount of waste). What is on top of that you needed to gather data about those people and manage that
data? That's the problem that I attempted to solve.


Given a list of last names, ASP_Finder will find people with those last names in the area of your choice, and generate an 
efficient route to visit all of those people. ASP_Finder will also let you gather some data to confirm whether the people do
speak the language or not, and based on that data it will continuously adjust the list.
